# my_cat

**Description**

It's your turn to code the software cat!

Create a program called my_cat which does the same thing as the system's cat command-line.

Read the content of each file which are received as an argument to your software.
You don't have to handle any options. :-)

[[examples]]
```
$>./my_cat file1 file2
content_file_1
content_file_2
$>
```
